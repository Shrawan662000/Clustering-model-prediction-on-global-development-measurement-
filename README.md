# Clustering-model-prediction-on-global-development-measurement-

In this project, I used various machine learning clustering algorithms to classify countries as developed or underdeveloped based on global development measurements. I deployed the model using streamlit, allowing users to input their own data and receive a prediction on the development status of their chosen country. This project likely involved preprocessing and cleaning data, training and evaluating different clustering models (K-means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN) and implementing the model in a user-friendly interface. Overall, the goal of the project was to provide a tool for understanding and comparing development levels across different countries.
